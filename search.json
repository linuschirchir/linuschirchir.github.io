Our goal is to determine how well different generation strategies reproduce the statistical properties and analytic value of the original data while protecting privacy. We generate synthetic data using four approaches: (1) parametric imputation (MICE), (2) non-parametric imputation (CART via MICE), (3) distribution-driven synthesis (synthpop), and (4) metadata-guided rules. We then compare each synthetic dataset with the real data across three dimensions:\n\nFidelity – univariate and multivariate similarity (distributions, ranges, correlations), histogram similarity, and mutual information.\nUtility – model transportability using XGBoost (TRTR vs. TSTR), feature-importance agreement, and SHAP-based behaviour.\nPrivacy / Disclosure risk – exact record matches, neighbour-proximity checks, and membership-inference sensitivity.\n\nRead the full article here"

The world was grappling with the peak of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, and the outbreak of a new variant, Omicron, was a stark reminder of the urgency and importance of Health Data Science (HDS). Driven by a passion for using data to solve complex health challenges, I embarked on my master’s studies in HDS.\nDuring my studies, I explored courses such as Machine Learning (ML), Data Modelling, Data Visualisation, Bioinformatics for Genome Analysis, Analysis of Linked Health Data, and Scientific Computing in Healthcare. My dissertation “Evaluating Cognitive Assessments in the Progression to Early-Stage Alzheimer’s Disease Using Machine Learning,” provided practical experience in applying these skills to real-world problems. Additionally, I engaged in projects using R and QGIS to visualise global COVID-19 trends and applied ML techniques in R to predict heart disease.\nRead the full article on Medium"
